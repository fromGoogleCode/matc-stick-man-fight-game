Me and Drew Planing to do Match stick man AcTion Game which need 2 people fight each other.

Plan

keyboard

We are going to use a P/S2 keyboard. So we need to study and research how does P/S2 keyboard work, what is its output for one key, or more key at same time. Then study about how keyboard related to FPGA, clock, defualt code for key. Finally using verilog to build a FSM to receive the input for the game properly.

VGA

Going to study how it works, under what condition it works. because we are building a action game, there will involve a lot of animations. based on the time we have we are going to at first build the minimum action we need, then make more action per fps.

game

This study about how we are going to design the game. setting up the rules and build algorithm for the game only.


control

Build a FSM that include the game rules, and  keyboard input and VGA output that properly  interact with each other.
